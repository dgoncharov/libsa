1.
2. Minimize the number of times input or anything else has to be scanned.
3. Minimize the number of allocations.
4. Use alloca for small allocations.
   alloca is faster, but less portable and restricted by the size of the frame.
5. Get rid of copying from char[] to int[].
6. Use bitset to store type.
7. Maybe use a type other than int* to store input for smaller inputs?
   Maybe pass void * and typesize?
8. Write a readme.
9.
10. Is memcpy of buckets in insert_lms and induce_l needed?
11. Profile.
12. Generate a test which causes deep recursion.
13. Portable makefile, usable on sun, 32, 64 bits, profiling.
14. If there are few distinct values in input compared to abclen, then
    it is possible to map all values in input to smaller values and have a
    smaller buckets array. At the cost of small run time overhead and source
    code complication.
15. Replace recursion with iteration.
16. The alignment of the output of buckets from print_sa gets messed up with
    abclen > 99. Use abclen as a width specifier instead of %2.
17. Fix wrapping of printed long inputs - either print vertically or print 79
    chars and start a new line.
18. Test with clang.
19. reduce assumes that the lms blocks in result are sorted. Add an assert
    in reduce that enforces this assumption.
20. Figure out how to have the first loop in reduce scan through lms blocks,
    rather than input. Maybe allocate another sorted_lms and init this
    sorted_lms in induce_s and then have reduce scan through sorted_lms?
21. Compare the lengths of lms blocks in lms_blocks_differ before the loop.
    A beginning of one lms block the end of the prior lms block. This should be
    possible with sorted_lms from todo 20.
22. Expose alloc, alloc_init, alloc_copy to libsa.t.c.
